        Like Undertale, Deltarune is a role-playing video game with a top-down perspective.[6] The player directly controls a human named Kris,[7] but has a party of other characters which they select actions for during battle.[8][9] The game includes both overworld and combat sections; in the former, players can solve puzzles,[10] collect items, and interact with characters and the world.[11] The random encounter system from Undertale has been removed; players can see the enemies in the environment before they encounter them, allowing for the possibility of avoiding or deliberately initiating combat.[12]

The game uses a turn-based combat system, where players can choose from a set of actions each turn: Fight, Act, Item, Magic, Spare, and Defend.[9] As in Undertale, players control a heart-shaped soul in a fixed area, which must dodge enemy attacks in the form of bullets,[13][10] though the exact mechanics are sometimes unique to the respective enemy.[14] Defending or "grazing" an incoming attack by letting it come close to the heart without getting hit by it, increases the Tension Points (TP) gauge, which allows party members to use spells or particular acts.[9] For example, Ralsei can pacify tired enemies with a spell.[12]

Using acts and spells allows a player to spare enemies non-violently; from the second chapter, this can allow them to be recruited to live in the player's Castle Town.[13][8] Alternatively, fighting an enemy, which also increases TP, can lead to them being defeated violently.[11] When a party member's hit points (HP) drop below zero, they are downed and will not be able to fight until revived. The HP of downed party members will regenerate slowly until it reaches 1, but other healing sources can also revive a downed party member. For example, the ReviveMint, which also heals additional health.[15][9]
